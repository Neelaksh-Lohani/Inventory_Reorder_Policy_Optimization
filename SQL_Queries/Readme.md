### SQL Queries — Brief Description 

> This folder contains PostgreSQL queries used to construct weekly SKU-level demand signals, estimate demand variability and lead time uncertainty, compute safety stock and reorder points for a 95% service-level target, simulate policy gaps between current and variability-adjusted reorder levels, and quantify the incremental working capital required for inventory policy correction.
