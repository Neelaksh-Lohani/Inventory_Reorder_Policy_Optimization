### Power BI Dashboard — Brief Description

> This dashboard evaluates SKU-level inventory reorder policy adequacy under demand and lead time variability by comparing current reorder points with variability-adjusted thresholds required for a 95% service-level target. It highlights reorder gaps, safety buffer requirements, and the associated working capital impact to support risk-aware replenishment planning.
